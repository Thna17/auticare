 * /notifications renders a different view per role.
 *
 * The route previously loaded the school view for everyone with no role guard, so
 * a parent who reached this URL got a page that immediately called
 * `/schools/notifications` and was refused with 403s. Schools and parents have
 * genuinely different notifications — a school approves enrollment requests,
 * a parent reads updates about their child — so this switches rather than trying
 * to serve both from one component.
 *
 * Roles with no notification feed of their own get an empty state instead of a
 * failing page.
